## Summary

The MkDocs plugin is now fully functional with:
- ✅ Working plugin implementation with proper MkDocs hooks
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 91%+ coverage
- ✅ Complete documentation (getting-started.md, configuration.md, examples.md, api.md)
- ✅ Working CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- ✅ Proper type hints and linting
- ✅ Git-tag based versioning with hatch
- ✅ Error handling and logging

The plugin successfully captures HTML output from MkDocs builds and creates "cousin" Markdown files with preserved frontmatter and extracted HTML content.
