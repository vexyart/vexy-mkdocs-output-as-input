### üîß Submit Code Changes

Ready to code? Follow these steps:

#### 1. Set Up Development Environment

```bash

./scripts/dev-setup.sh
```

#### 2. Make Your Changes

Follow our coding standards:

**Python Style Guide**
```python
# Use type hints
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional, List

def process_files(
    paths: List[Path],
    verbose: bool = False
) -> Optional[int]:
    """Process multiple files.
    
    Args:
        paths: List of file paths to process
        verbose: Enable verbose logging
        
    Returns:
        Number of files processed, or None on error
    """
    count = 0
    for path in paths:
        if verbose:
            logger.info(f"Processing {path}")
        # Process file
        count += 1
    return count
```

**Commit Message Format**
```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# Types:
# - feat: New feature
# - fix: Bug fix
# - docs: Documentation only
# - style: Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.
# - refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# - test: Adding missing tests
# - chore: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

git commit -m "feat(plugin): add support for custom processors"
git commit -m "fix(parser): handle malformed HTML gracefully"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
```

#### 3. Test Your Changes

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

#### Testing Requirements

- All new features must have tests
- Maintain or improve code coverage (>90%)
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions

Example test:
```python
def test_custom_processor(plugin, temp_dir):
    """Test custom processor functionality."""
    # Arrange: Set up test conditions
    plugin.config["custom_processor"] = lambda x: x.upper()
    test_file = temp_dir / "test.md"
    test_file.write_text("# hello world")
    
    # Act: Execute the functionality
    plugin.process_file(test_file)
    
    # Assert: Verify the results
    output = (temp_dir / "stage" / "test.md").read_text()
    assert "HELLO WORLD" in output
```

#### Documentation Standards

- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include type hints
- Provide usage examples
- Document exceptions

```python
def extract_content(
    html: str,
    selector: str = "main"
) -> Optional[str]:
    """Extract content from HTML using CSS selector.
    
    Args:
        html: HTML document as string
        selector: CSS selector to match elements
        
    Returns:
        Extracted HTML content or None if not found
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If selector is empty
        ParseError: If HTML is malformed
        
    Example:
        >>> html = "<main><p>Content</p></main>"
        >>> extract_content(html, "main")
        '<main><p>Content</p></main>'
    """
```

### Performance Considerations

- Use generators for large datasets
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Profile code for bottlenecks
- Consider memory usage

```python
# Good: Generator for memory efficiency
def process_files(self, paths: List[Path]) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Process files one at a time."""
    for path in paths:
        yield self.process_single_file(path)

# Bad: Loading everything into memory
def process_files(self, paths: List[Path]) -> List[Path]:
    """Process all files at once."""
    return [self.process_single_file(p) for p in paths]
```

### Security Guidelines

- Sanitize user input
- Use safe YAML loading
- Validate file paths
- Handle sensitive data carefully

```python
# Good: Safe YAML loading
import yaml
data = yaml.safe_load(content)

# Bad: Unsafe loading
data = yaml.load(content, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)
```

## Review Process

### What to Expect

3. **Feedback**: You may receive suggestions or requests for changes
4. **Iteration**: Make requested changes and push updates
5. **Merge**: Once approved, your PR will be merged

### Review Criteria

- **Correctness**: Does it work as intended?
- **Tests**: Are there adequate tests?
- **Documentation**: Is it well-documented?
- **Style**: Does it follow conventions?
- **Performance**: Is it efficient?
- **Security**: Is it secure?
