# Work Progress on vexy-mkdocs-output-as-input

## Completed Sprint: Code Quality & Documentation

### Tasks Completed:

1. **✅ Upgraded Type Hints to Python 3.12+ Standards**
   - Replaced Optional[T] with T | None throughout the codebase
   - Used built-in types (list, dict) instead of typing module imports
   - Created type aliases (FrontmatterDict, ConfigDict, etc.) for better readability

2. **✅ Implemented Loguru Logging**
   - Replaced standard logging with loguru in both plugin.py and cli.py
   - Added structured logging with context (path, error, elapsed time)
   - Included performance metrics for file processing
   - Added loguru as a dependency in pyproject.toml

3. **✅ Enhanced Documentation Site**
   - Created comprehensive MkDocs Material site structure in src_docs/
   - Added 5 documentation pages:
     - index.md: Overview and introduction
     - getting-started.md: Installation and quick start guide
     - configuration.md: Complete configuration reference
     - examples.md: Real-world use cases and workflows
     - api.md: Technical API documentation with mkdocstrings
   - Added custom CSS and JavaScript enhancements
   - Configured advanced Material theme features

4. **✅ Improved Test Coverage**
   - Achieved 95.94% test coverage (exceeding 90% requirement)
   - Added tests for edge cases and error scenarios
   - Created test_missing_coverage.py for uncovered code paths
   - Added CLI main execution tests
   - Added --version flag to CLI tool

### Additional Improvements:

- Updated file path references (this_file comments)
- Improved error messages with helpful context
- Enhanced docstrings with Google style formatting
- Successfully built and tested documentation site
- Verified plugin functionality with stage directory output

### Summary:

All immediate priority tasks have been completed successfully. The codebase now features:
- Modern Python 3.12+ type hints
- Comprehensive structured logging
- 95.94% test coverage
- Professional documentation site
- Improved developer experience

The project is now ready for the next phase of improvements as outlined in PLAN.md.
